# Type representation in markdown documents

* Status: Accepted
* Date: 2021-02-18

## Context and Problem Statement

The values of fields need to be represented in the markdown documents. How are different types represented?

## Considered Options

* Custom (specific to `semplate`) representations
* Default Java representations
* Representations can be chosen by the user in the template.

## Decision Outcome

Default Java representations are used.

Representations chosen by the user in the template have not been rejected, but are maybe a feature for a future release.

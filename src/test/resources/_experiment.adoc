 with Glaucon, the son of Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new thing.

When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant Polemarchus, the son of Cephalus, chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him.

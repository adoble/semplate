# Description

**Semplate** is a java library to create and maintain markup documents by:
* adding  semantic information
* using user defined templates

It works with both [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and [Asciidoc](http://asciidoc.org/).

# Status

Still under development. Probably nothing works right now.
